/-- A typeclass for *fueled* random generation, i.e. a variant of
    the `Arbitrary` typeclass where the fuel for the generator is made explicit.
    - This typeclass is equivalent to Rocq QuickChick's `arbitrarySized` typeclass
      (QuickChick uses the `Nat` parameter as both fuel and the generator size,
       here we use it just for fuel, as Plausible's `Gen` type constructor
       already internalizes the size parameter.) -/

  /-- Takes a `Nat` and produces a random generator dependent on the `Nat` parameter
      (which indicates the amount of fuel to be used before failing). -/
